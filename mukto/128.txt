Mukto Jewellery Branding

Mukto found by Meriç Altın in 2012, designing free and coincidental jewelry forged with metal, fire and the soul. The logo involves ''The man blowing his own fortress'', a story about the man who reconstruct himself over time and experience. He made two rings on this story and had a logo he wanted to change.

While designing new projects Meriç starts with the material.  Taking it in hand and looking at it trying to figure out what it needs to be in it's new life.  We recreated this figure as if it's a single line of metal in Meriç's hands. Bended and twisted into a new story from it's existing form. And used it in our new branding and packaging design.
