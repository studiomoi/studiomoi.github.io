Simya Evi Re-Branding

We partnered with Simya Evi, a natural skincare brand created by a pharmacist mother and her toxicologist daughter, to refresh their brand identity and packaging while preserving their signature fairy girl logo.

Inspired by the name 'Simya' (Alchemy), our new branding incorporates alchemy symbols, reinforcing the brand's narrative and its connection to the fairy emblem.

The relaunch timeline was tight, demanding a swift solution for promotional imagery without waiting for physical packaging production and photography. Our solution was to go fully digital.

We created detailed 3D models of all products and packaging, generating realistic lifestyle images digitally. This efficient process bypassed the need for traditional photoshoots, saving valuable time typically spent on logistics like location scouting, casting, and shooting days, and delivered impactful visuals ready for the relaunch.
