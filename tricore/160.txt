Tricore Academy Branding

We collaborated with Tricore Academy, established by a dedicated triathlon coach, to craft their brand identity. The primary goal was a logo that was both modern and immediately recognizable within the triathlon community.

Inspired by the multi-stage nature of the sport, we focused on its fundamental components: swim, cycle, and run. We created distinct graphic symbols representing each phase: a fluid wave for the swim, a steady line for the cycle, and a dynamic pulse for the run.

These icons form the core symbol of the logo, visually echoing the 'Tri' in Tricore and offering a clear visual representation of their expertise.
